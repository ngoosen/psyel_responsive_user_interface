# PSYEL Responsive User Interface

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

The objective of this project is to create a responsive user interface using an external API for [ULB's Faculté de Psychologie des Sciences de l'Éducation et de Logopédie](https://psycho.ulb.be/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Progress

I chose to use a simple design, for a time reason as well as for clarity and easy and intuitive use.

I decided to use this project to challenge my CSS skills by using as few libraries as possible and use a CSS first approach. For this reason, I also tried to not use too much Typescript for user interaction.

For this project, I developed a local proxy that consumes an external API, using the tools offered by Next.js.

## Next up

This project is not yet quite done. Things I still need to work on includes (but are not limited to):

- Really show off my CSS/SCSS skills by adding crispier transitions, animations and interactions for a beautiful and less boring design.
